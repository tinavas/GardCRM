#  There's a hierarchy of how configured settings will override each other.   #
#  This file is the 2nd-lowest in priority for configuring settings in the    #
#  chain. The hierarchy runs as follows, where higher numbers override        #
#  lower numbers:                                                             #
#                                                                             #
#    --( lowest priority )--                                                  #
#    1. default values (as set within the add-on itself, not editable)        #
#    2. settings set in the `bloodhound.yaml` configuration file (this file)  #
#    3. settings set in the `dataset` YAML file corresponding to the          #
#       `dataset` parameter set on a Bloodhound tag itself                    #
#    4. parameters set on the Bloodhound tag itself (when possible)           #
#    --( highest priority )--                                                 #
#                                                                             #
#  You'll notice that #4 on the list above says "(when possible)," this is    #
#  because some settings require lists. Any parameter requiring a list        #
#  cannot be set as a parameter at tag-level.                                 #
#                                                                             #
#  For best results, if you'll only have one search on your site (which is    #
#  the most common scenario), set all of your settings here in this file.     #
#  If you're going to have multiple sets of data to search through on your    #
#  site, we recommend that you either set all settings into a dataset, or     #
#  set "global" settings here, and override as needed within a dataset.       #
#  Either way, if you choose to use a dataset, don't forget to reference      #
#  your dataset on your tag.                                                  #
#                                                                             #
#  All of the available settings have been listed below. If a setting has a   #
#  default value set within the add-on itself, that value is listed. Simply   #
#  comment out the setting you which to set and set it.                       #
#                                                                             #
#  And of course, for complete details, read the full documentation at        #
